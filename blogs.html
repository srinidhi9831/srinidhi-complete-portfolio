    <p class="p-blog">Mysore is a city which retains a lot of old world charm. Mysore is the city of silk and sandalwood.
      There are some areas in the city which seem to have been caught in a time warp, as if time has stood still
     and life goes on in a leisurely and unhurried pace. However things are changing and Mysore too is changing gears. 
     But, one can still bask in the old world elegance even today.

     It is about 145 Kilometers by road from the State capital of Bangalore. The city has a rich history and culture
