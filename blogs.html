        one must visit place is the chamundi hills located 8km from the city of mysore.
        If one wants to admire royalty then mysore palace is the place, if one visits in the evening then one can notice lights in the palace that looks
        like a golden crown of mysore city.
        Also other than that ooty and coorg is very near to mysore which is around 130km.The best part is to visit mysore
