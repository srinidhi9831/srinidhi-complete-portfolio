        mysore. Apart from huge crowd in marriages and other functions they served hot and tasty matka biryani to everyone.
        According to food caterers in the city, the demand for 'Matka veg biryani' has increased and continues to see an 
        upward surge.This new concept serves serves biryani in clay pot and is a major attraction for many.
      matka or clay pot made from red clay mud is what our ancestors used to store water and foods and also there are 
    lot of health benifits by eating or drinking from clay pot.everyone must try this delicious food.Its not only biryani 
there are lots of recipies being served in clay pot or matka , and one such recipie is ice cream  with fruit salad
on top and served with clay pots. <br>
  There are two ways to make matka biryani , one way is to cook completely in the clay pot which is little tedious and 
time consuming and lot of them do not follow this way of cooking pot biryani.
The other way and easiest way is to cook in any vessel and when it semi boiled then shift that to a clay pot and 
cover the lid and seal the lid with a paste made by maida or refined wheat flour, keep the flame in low and let it cook
for few minutes and then matka biryani is ready to serve and there is no compromise in taste."what sets it apart from
a regular biryani is the aroma that comes along with cooking it in a clay pot.As the pot biryani is kept in dum 
a new essence gets added to the mixture".<br>
This was introduced first by srihari caterers mysore which was started in 2015 by properiotor srihari s who is an MBA graduate.

the best in town caterers.They provide very good service including marriage , house warming  and other corporate events.
